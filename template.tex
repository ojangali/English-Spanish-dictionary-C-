This program works as an online dictionary.  It reads a word

    data from the ``dict.dat'' file.

{\color{blue} Chapter 2 may be enough to get you started, but as soon and as much as you can, you should read
all of {\it Part One : chapters 1-13}. The focus of this semester is {\it Part Two : chapters 14-28}.
